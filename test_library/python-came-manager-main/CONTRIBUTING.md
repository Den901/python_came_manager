# Contributing to this repository <!-- omit in toc -->

Contributing to this project should be as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features

## IMPORTANT! Install development environment first

When making changes in code, please use the existing development environment â€” this will save you from many errors and help create more convenient code to support.

To install the environment, run the `./bin/setup` script.

## Github is used for everything

Github is used to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've changed something, update the documentation.
3. Make sure your code lints (using black).
4. Issue that pull request!

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](../../issues)

GitHub issues are used to track public bugs.
Report a bug by [opening a new issue](../../issues/new/choose); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports. We are not even kidding.

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

Use [black](https://github.com/ambv/black) to make sure the code follows the style.

This program (and not only this) is automatically applied on code commit if you set up the developer environment as indicated at the beginning of this document. Please make this set up. It will greatly facilitate your work.

## License

By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under its #todo

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same License that covers the whole project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.
